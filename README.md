# VHDL for Noobs

## Introduction

This repository contains a few VHDL code samples for various logic devices commonly used in FPGA-based digital design. Refer to these examples as a starting point for comprehending and implementing logic circuits in VHDL on FPGA platforms.

## Usage

### Vivado Projects

- The `Vivado Projects` directory contains Vivado 2023.1 project files.
- Open the `.xpr` files in Vivado to run simulations and view synthesis schematics.

### Raw VHDL

- The `Raw VHDL` directory contains just the extracted VHDL code from the main projects and their testbenches for quick reference.
- You can use these files in any other VHDL environment, such as Xilinx ISE 14.7, ModelSim, Altera, Cadence etc.
